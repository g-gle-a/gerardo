# gerardo

This  small project simulates a "brownian motion.... a drop composed by several molecules start to move ramdously. after some iterations molecules start to collide each other, assuming elastic collisions, de balls move in opossite directions.
The collision is noted by colour changes of the spheres. The initial and slightly different code was dropped from internet.
